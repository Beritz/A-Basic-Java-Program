# A-Basic-Java-Program
Its a java program I created which lets you enter the details of n numbers of students and to get their grades for average marks of 5 subjects. it needs a little bit tweaking up to do. Â 
The problem with this code is that the Student Number(S_no) ends up repeating itself. i want that bug to fixed. Im using a static int variable type for S_no.
